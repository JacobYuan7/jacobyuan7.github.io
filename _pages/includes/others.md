# ðŸ’¬ Miscellaneous
**English Proficiency**: 
I once dabbled with the TOEFL and snagged a score of 107. Not to brag, but I also clinched the Special Prize (top 0.1%) in the National English Competition for College Students. English reading and writing? Totally my jam, although there's always room for improvement. Flashback to high school: I entertained the idea of moonlighting as a translator. Fast forward to now: English has morphed into more of a hobby as I dive deep into the world of AI research. While I'm cerntainly no linguistic prodigy, there's a certain joy I find in crafting sentences in English, especially when penning down my research papers. But then GPT-4 came along and made my hobby feel, well, a tad redundant. ðŸ˜… Why? Because this section is also polished by GPT-4.

I took a TOEFL test and obtains 107 and I was awareded Special Prize in National English Competition for College Students.
I kinda enjoy reading and writing in English but I still have a lot to improve.
Once upon a time (perhaps in high school), I thought about making a living on being a translator.
Now, it becomes more of a hobby because I am currently an AI researcher.
Unlike those linguistic genius, I am not that brilliant but find myself quite happy when writing in English, like when I write my research paper. 
Unfortunately, after the emergence of GPT-4, my hobby becomes rather useless.-->
