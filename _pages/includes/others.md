# üí¨ Miscellaneous

- **Goal of my research**:
While conducting research, I prioritize humanity above all else. Therefore, the ultimate goal of my research is to **prioritize human well-being**.

- **Characteristics**:
  - I am friendly from a personal perspective (this is not biased!).
  Although I major in Computer Science Engineering, I am quite emotionally sensitive, often grasping other people's sense of feelings faster than most people. (Some people may say this is a gift. Well, I'll take it!)
However, I am not emotionally vulnerable.

  - I describe myself as **a realistic idealist**. For years, I have been searching for the purpose of life and found my Goal of Research (see above). I resonate with Steve Jobs' philosophy, saying that *"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."*.

- The following list might be dynamic üòÜ.

  - **Favoriate singer**: Taylor Swift. I officially became a Swiftie after the release of "Safe & Sound".
 
  - **Concerts that I have been to**:
      - Ed Sheeran's +-=√∑√ó Tour in Hangzhou, 2025 (where I saw Langlang.).
      - Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in London, 2024 (where I saw Ed Sheeran as well!).
      - Coldplay's Music of the Spheres World Tour in Singapore, 2024.
      - One Love Asia Festival in Singapore, 2023.

  - **Favoriate athlete / football club**: Kylian Mbapp√© and Tottenham Hotspur F.C. We're on a mission to win a trophy! And yeah, I respect the big guys like Man City, Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal... even if they are the competition.

  - **Favoriate movie / TV Series**: *Iron Man I*, *While You Were Sleeping* (i.e., ÎãπÏã†Ïù¥ Ïû†Îì† ÏÇ¨Ïù¥Ïóê, starring Bae Suzy and Lee Jong-suk), *the Harry Potter series* (I am a fan of Hermione Granger), *Batman* (starring Christian Bale, including Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises), *The Amazing Spider-Man I&II* (starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone).


- **English proficiency**: 
I once dabbled with the TOEFL and snagged a score of 107. Not to brag, but I also clinched the Special Prize (top 0.1%) in the National English Competition for College Students. English reading and writing? Totally my jam, although there's much room for improvement. Flashback to high school: I entertained the idea of moonlighting as a translator. Fast forward to now: English has morphed into more of a hobby as I dive deep into the world of AI research. While I'm certainly no linguistic prodigy, there's a certain joy I find in crafting sentences in English, especially when penning down my research papers. But then GPT-4 came along and made my hobby feel, well, a tad redundant. üòÖ Why? Because this section is also polished by GPT-4.
