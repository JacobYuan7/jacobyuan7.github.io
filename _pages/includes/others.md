# ðŸ’¬ Miscellaneous
**English Proficiency**: 
I once dabbled with the TOEFL and snagged a score of 107. Not to brag, but I also clinched the Special Prize (top 0.1%) in the National English Competition for College Students. English reading and writing? Totally my jam, although there's much room for improvement. Flashback to high school: I entertained the idea of moonlighting as a translator. Fast forward to now: English has morphed into more of a hobby as I dive deep into the world of AI research. While I'm cerntainly no linguistic prodigy, there's a certain joy I find in crafting sentences in English, especially when penning down my research papers. But then GPT-4 came along and made my hobby feel, well, a tad redundant. ðŸ˜… Why? Because this section is also polished by GPT-4.
